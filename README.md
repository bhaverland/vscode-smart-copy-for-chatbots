# Smart Copy for Chatbots

This extension, "Smart Copy for Chatbots," enhances productivity by allowing users to easily copy the relative path, file name, and contents of the current file in Visual Studio Code. This information is formatted in a way that's convenient for pasting into chatbots, like **ChatGPT**, or other text-based interfaces.

## Features

- **Copy File Information**: Quickly copy the relative path, file name, and contents of the current file to the clipboard.
- **Easy Access**: Use the extension via the Command Palette, right-click context menu, or an icon in the editor's title bar.

> Tip: This extension is particularly useful for developers working with chatbots, documentation, or any scenario where quick access to file information is beneficial.

**Using this extension should give you the following output to your clipboard:**
```
File Path: {relative path of the active file}
File Name: {name of the active file}

{contents of the active file}
```
